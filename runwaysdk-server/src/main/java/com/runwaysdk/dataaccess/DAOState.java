/**
 * Stores the state of an {@link EntityDAO} object. This strategy pattern allows for the state of
 * a reference to an object that was created before a transaction to have its state properly updated 
 * after a transaction. The transaction cache updates the state of the object at the end of the 
 * transaction, but a different object reference is updated. Therefore, an object reference made prior 
 * to a transaction to an object that is updated by a transaction may not have its state properly updated 
 * immediately after the transaction.
 * 
 * The subclass {@link DAOStateDefault} is the default state when an {@link EntityDAO} object is 
 * instantiated. 
 * 
 * The subclass {@link DAOStatePostTransaction} is set on an {@link EntityDAO} object just before it
 * is placed into the transaction cache, where it is then serialized into another reference. The original
 * reference will then have its state updated as soon as the next read to its state is made. After the state
 * is updated, the strategy should switch to {@link DAOStateDefault}.
