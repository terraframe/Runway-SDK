Testing

  Runway SDK is tested via integration tests. Our primary integration test is called Ueber Test Suite, and is run nightly on our Hudson continuous integration server.

* @Request Annotation

  This annotation is used internally, and mostly for testing. This annotation is required on methods that access the core outside the scope of a typical session request. When this annotation is used a new request and session is created with the user of SYSTEM. If the method is annotated with both @Request and @Transaction then the @Request annotation must precede the @Transaction annotation.
